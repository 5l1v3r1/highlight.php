The following tests for highlight.js are not rewritten for highlight.php

- special explicitLanguage
Controlling language selection by setting an attribute to the containing DIV
is irrelevant for highlight.php

- special customMarkup
In highlight.js code may contain additional HTML markup like in the following
PHP fragment: '$sum = <b>$a</b> + $b;'. Currently this is not supported by
highlight.php. highlight.php can only highlight (unescaped) code. Also 
HTML breaks <br> code to highlight is not supported. highlight.php does support
tab replacement (defaults to 4 spaces).

- special noHighlight
There is no need to turn off highlighting through a class name on the code
container.

- special buildClassName
highlight.php does not modify class names of code containers.
